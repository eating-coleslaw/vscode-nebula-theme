# Nebula Theme for VS Code
🌌🌸Fresh colors on a dark, cold slate. An almost-material theme for Visual Studio Code.

## __Configuration__

Instead of bundling together several Nebula theme variants, there's only one main theme file that's dynamically generated based on a few configuration settings. Customize the theme to suit your preferences without leaving VS Code!  

### _Comment Italics_

Toggle whether code comments are italicized using the `nebula-theme.commentItalics` setting.

### _Theme Italics_

Select the amount of italicized code you prefer, or disable code italics completely using the `nebula-theme.themeItalics` setting. Choose from five flavors:

- `0 - None`
- `1 - Basic`
- `2 - Wavy`
- `3 - Curly`
- `4 - No Restraint`

### _Materialize_

For those that favor flat-style UIs, enable the `nebula-theme.materialize`. This will hide borders between workbench sections and a few other select elements.

## __Issues__

 There's not much precedent for this style of theme configurability, so I expect a bumpy ride for these first few minor releases. If you notice any issues, particularly around the configuration options, updates, and activation, please write it up with reproduction steps on the github repo. Please be nice, though; I learned typescript with this development 😅.

 My primary concern after functional problems is accessibility-related problems. If there's something I could update or add, don't hesitate to write up an issue on the github repo with your suggestion.

## __Credits__

The configurability of this theme was made possibly thanks to Philipp Kief's generous licensing of the source code to his wonderful [Material Icon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PKief.material-icon-theme). I highly recommend installing it alongside Nebula, using a folder color of `#CDF6FE`.
